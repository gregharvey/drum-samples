# drum-samples
Open source drum samples and loops.

This repo is going to be a continuous work in progress!

I'm starting out simply with the GSCW drum samples, which I got back in the early 'noughties' and have travelled with me since. The Internet is littered with mentions of them, but you don't seem to be able to download them anywhere any more. I have no idea what the license is, or even if there is one - I presume someone recorded them and gave them away at some point in the '90s? So unless or until someone proves to me they're *not* open source, I'll post them here.

I intend to add Hydrogen libraries for them as well and my own Pearl Export kit in the fullness of time. Plus anything else relevant I come across.
